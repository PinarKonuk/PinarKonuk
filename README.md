# 👋 Hi, I'm Pınar Konuk  

I'm a Computer Engineer who builds intelligent, data-driven systems — and cares about how they scale, automate, and run in the real world.

My journey combines **Data & AI, Cloud/DevOps, and Enterprise Integration**, giving me a full-stack understanding of how modern products are designed, deployed, and improved.

### 🚀 What I Do

🔹 **Data & AI** – Turning data into insights and building ML-powered solutions  
🔹 **DevOps & Cloud** – Automating software delivery and containerized environments  
🔹 **Digital Transformation & ERP** – SAP integration and AI-driven business process optimization  

This unique mix allows me to work across the lifecycle of an intelligent system:  
from data → to model → to automated deployment → to real business value.

### 🧠 Current Focus

I’m currently expanding my Cloud & DevOps skills through the **Huawei DevOps Bootcamp**, with hands-on experience in:

- CI/CD pipelines (Git, Jenkins, Docker)  
- Containerization & orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes)  
- Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform)  

And I’m integrating my data/ML background into this — aiming toward **MLOps / AI Platform Engineering**.
